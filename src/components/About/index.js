    <p className="aboutDescription">
      We build software products that make everyday business interactions within
      the organization and with the outside world smarter. In essence, creating
      nextgen worker & customer experiences through design & technology. Smarter
      business interaction (an instance of communication, or a business process,
      or whole system of connected processes) that is not only structured,
      intuitive, and resource optimized but also is highly scalable, global and
      intelligent. All businesses have different priorities when it comes to
      their video conferencing software choice depending on their industry,
      size, budgets and key use cases. For some small businesses, cost is the
      primary consideration, while others put a premium on security, reliability
      and support â€” perks typically associated with enterprise.
